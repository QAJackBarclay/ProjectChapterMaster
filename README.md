* [Project Brief](#Project-Brief)  
    Project Chapter Master is the result of my solo project week two for QA ltd, this Project will display my first attempts to create an application, dock, pipeline and ansible in the given timeframe. The applicaiton should be functional and should be correctly deployed.
